<P><h2> Who are Transgenders  ? </h6> </p>
<p> <font size="+2"> An umbrella term describing individuals whose gender identity does not align in a traditional sense with the gender they were assigned at birth. It may also be used to refer to a person whose gender identity is binary and not traditionally associated with that assigned at birth.

<p> <font size="+2">Transgender people are people whose gender identity is different from the gender they were thought to be at birth. “Trans” is often used as shorthand for transgender.
When we're born, a doctor usually says that we're male or female based on what our bodies look like. Most people who were labeled male at birth turn out to actually identify as men, and most people who were labeled female at birth grow up to be women. But some people's gender identity – their innate knowledge of who they are – is different from what was initially expected when they were born. Most of these people describe themselves as transgender.
A transgender woman lives as a woman today, but was thought to be male when she was born. A transgender man lives as a man today, but was thought to be female when he was born. Some transgender people identify as neither male nor female, or as a combination of male and female. There are a variety of terms that people who aren't entirely male or entirely female use to describe their gender identity, like non-binary or genderqueer. </font></p>

<p><B><font size="+3">Challenges faced by Transgender Children:
</font></b></p>
<p> <font size="+2">Every child has a fundamental right to live with dignity and receive equal treatment. Children who identify themselves as transgender have always been treated as outcasts, faced discrimination in India, and have been denied a life of dignity. The nomenclature “Third Gender” poses significant problems. It makes them feel a sense of inferiority toward the other two genders.
Although the Supreme Court provided them with legal recognition, the ground reality has not changed because it has failed to alleviate their marginalization. States have failed miserably to implement the rules and provisions set forth in all applicable laws and policies for transgender people. There are various challenges faced by transgender children.

<p><B><font size="+3">Status of transgender in India?</font></b></p>
<p> <font size="+2">

In India, transgender persons were recognised as the 'third gender' in 2014. The third gender population of India is marginalized to a great extent in every sector. Often, transgender persons have been the subjects of sociology, psychology, and health issues.

<p><B><font size="+3">What is the literacy rate of transgenders in India?
</font></b></p>
<p> <font size="+2">Most transgender people are abandoned by their family and society and face a lot of humiliation and injustice, leaving them socially, economically, and educationally backward in the community. As per the 2011 census, India's transgender population is around 4.88 lakh, with a literacy rate of 56.07%.

<h2>How can I be supportive of transgender family members, friends, or significant others?</h2>
<ul type="triangle">
<li><font size="+3">Educate yourself about transgender issues by reading books, attending conferences, and consulting with transgender experts. Be aware of your attitudes concerning people with gender-nonconforming appearance or behavior.</font></li>
<li><font size="+3">Know that transgender people have membership in various sociocultural identity groups (e.g., race, social class, religion, age, disability, etc.) and there is not one universal way to look or be transgender.</font></li>
<li><font size="+3">Use names and pronouns that are appropriate to the person’s gender presentation and identity; if in doubt, ask.</font></li>
<li><font size="+3">Don’t make assumptions about transgender people’s orientation, desire for hormonal or medical treatment, or other aspects of their identity or transition plans. If you have a reason to know (e.g., you are a physician conducting a necessary physical exam or you are a person who is interested in dating someone that you’ve learned is transgender), ask.</font></li>
<li><font size="+3">Don’t confuse gender nonconformity with being transgender. Not all people who appear androgynous or gender nonconforming identify as transgender or desire gender affirmation treatment.</font></li>
<li><font size="+3">Keep the lines of communication open with the transgender person in your life.</font></li>
<li><font size="+3">Get support in processing your own reactions. It can take some time to adjust to seeing someone you know well transitioning. Having someone close to you transition will be an adjustment and can be challenging, especially for partners, parents, and children.</font></li>
<li><font size="+3">Seek support in dealing with your feelings. You are not alone. Mental health professionals and support groups for family, friends, and significant others of transgender people can be useful resources.</font></li>
<li><font size="+3">Advocate for transgender rights, including social and economic justice and appropriate psychological care.Familiarize yourself with the local and state or provincial laws that protect transgender people from discrimination.</font></li>
